### Simple Network Integration

Terms of Service works for both new user and new site creation making it an excellent solution for WordPress, Multisite and BuddyPress networks. No tricky settings. Just activate and paste your Terms of Service into the text editor.

 

### Added Splog Blocker

Let people know what they are signing up for – and add another barrier of protection against automated splog creation. It’s effortless, and if visitors don’t agree to the Terms of Service no site will be created.
